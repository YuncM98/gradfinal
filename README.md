Introduction
As a major public transportation, airline market has been ushering a booming development. On a global scale, a continuous world-wide growth of air traffic could be observed, and according to several market researches, the growth is expected to maintain positive rates up to 2030.

However, there are many factors that affect the performance of the commercial aviation system, which can lead to annoying results to their passengers sometimes. Given the uncertain factors of the whole aviation system, passengers usually have to plan their travel many days or even months before the departure date. Meanwhile, in order to decrease the trip costs, avoid the rush traffic hours, and then obtain a relaxed travel experience, travelers also hope to gain as more detailed information as possible.

Converting the traditional numeric information into a more vivid visualization form, could help the viewers gain their desired information efficiently and easily. So, we intend to build a map based interactive consulting visualization, which combines two date sets coming from the US Department of Transportations Bureau of Transportation Statistics. We hope this application can reveal some potential patterns under the ﬂight records and display them to the viewers
